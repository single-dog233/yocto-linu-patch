Subject: [PATCH 002/158] sched: Introduce migratable()

Some areas use preempt_disable() + preempt_enable() to safely access
per-CPU data. The PREEMPT_RT folks have shown this can also be done by
keeping preemption enabled and instead disabling migration (and acquiring a
sleepable lock, if relevant).

Introduce a helper which checks whether the current task can be migrated
elsewhere, IOW if it is pinned to its local CPU in the current
context. This can help determining if per-CPU properties can be safely
accessed.

Note that CPU affinity is not checked here, as a preemptible task can have
its affinity changed at any given time (including if it has
PF_NO_SETAFFINITY, when hotplug gets involved).
