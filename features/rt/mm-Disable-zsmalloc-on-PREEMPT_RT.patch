Subject: [PATCH 025/158] mm: Disable zsmalloc on PREEMPT_RT

For efficiency reasons, zsmalloc is using a slim `handle'. The value is
the address of a memory allocation of 4 or 8 bytes depending on the size
of the long data type. The lowest bit in that allocated memory is used
as a bit spin lock.
The usage of the bit spin lock is problematic because with the bit spin
lock held zsmalloc acquires a rwlock_t and spinlock_t which are both
sleeping locks on PREEMPT_RT and therefore must not be acquired with
disabled preemption.

There is a patch which extends the handle on PREEMPT_RT so that a full
spinlock_t fits (even with lockdep enabled) and then eliminates the bit
spin lock. I'm not sure how sensible zsmalloc on PREEMPT_RT is given
that it is used to store compressed user memory.

Disable ZSMALLOC on PREEMPT_RT. If there is need for it, we can try to
get it to work.
